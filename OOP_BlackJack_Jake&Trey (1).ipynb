    "This well-known card game has very simple rules that anyone can pick up and learn quickly. In this game, there will be two players: the user and the dealer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the game is to get either a 21 or a score higher than the dealer that doesn't exceed 21. Numbered cards are worth the points they have (2 is two points, 10 is 10, etc.), and all face cards are worth 10 points. The ace is a special card, as it normally is 11 points but can be changed to 1 point if the user's score will exceed 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of the game, both the user and the dealer will draw two cards. The user's cards will be seen by both the dealer and user, but only the dealer's first card will be visible to the player. If the user's score with only his first two cards is 21 (also known as a natural 21), they automatically win. If not, the user will then be given 3 options: they can look at their cards and score, they can hit, or they can stand. \n",
    "\n",
    "If they hit, they draw another card. They can continue drawing until their score exceeds 21. If their score exceeds 21, they bust and lose, even if the dealer busts. If they stand, the dealer will flip his 2nd card for the user to see and will draw until their score is greater than or equal to 17. If the dealer reaches his requirement, then whoever has the highest score without busting wins. If they both bust, the user loses. If both players have the same score, they tie."
